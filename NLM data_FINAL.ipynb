    "The National Library of Medicine (NLM) produces a resource named HealthReach (http://healthreach.nlm.nih.gov) that provides access to free low literacy, mulitlingual health information to be used by healthcare providers with patients/clients.\n",
    "\n",
    "NLM collects the materials and indexes with controlled vocabulary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Users can access the HealthReach collection through the website but our interest is to make our collection available through an application programming interface (API). We curently have a closed API that we share with another NLM resource, and a hospital in Kenya that is pulling English, French, and Swahili materials into their patient electronic health records (EHR). HealthReach managers wants everyone to be able to pull the exact materials they want (determined by metadata) and use as they see fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, the majority of our users are in the healthcare service field and do not feel they are \"savvy\" in technology. Therefore dicussions of APIs and data often stall conversations about how they can customize the use of the HealthReach data. To make our current users more comfortbale with the multingual collection of HealthReach, we are creating visualizations of the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this presentation we plan to dispaly HealthReach collection data for our users.\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin, we pulled data from the HealthReach database and exported to an common-seperated value (.CSV) spreadsheet. We will use this data taken on Novermeber 28, 2018 for our visualization:\n",

    "We can view our the .CSV file, but that is a alot of data for a non-programmer to view. We have over 8,000 rows and 21 columns. Taking this data and making visualizations in PowerPoint or Tableau would be time consuming. Instead, we will use <b>Python for data anyalsis</b> or <b>pandas</b> for short. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let us begin by importing <b>pandas</b> so we can use it for our visualizations."
