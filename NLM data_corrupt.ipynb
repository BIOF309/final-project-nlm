    "NLM produces a resource named HealthReach (http://healthreach.nlm.nih.gov) that provides access to free low literacy, mulitlingual health information to be used by healthcare providers with patients/clients.\n",
    "\n",
    "NLM collects the materials and indexes with controlled vocabulary and fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "Users can access the HealthReach collection through the website but our interest is to make our collection available through API. We curently have a closed API that we share with another NLM resource, and a hospital in Kemnya that is pulling Englis, French, and Swahili materials into their patient electronic health records (EHR). HealthReach managers wants everyone to be able to pull the exact materials they want (determined by metadata) and use as they see fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, the majority of of users are in the healthcare service field and do not feel they are \"savy\" in technology, so dicussions of APIs and data seem to be the end of the conversation on how they can customize the use of the HealthReach data. In an effort to make current users more comfortbale with the multingual collection of HealthReach, we offer our data in visualizations. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this presentation we plan to dispaly HealthReach collection data for our users.\n",

    "To begin, we pulled data from the HealthReach database and exported to an common-seperated value (.CSV) spreadsheet. We will use this data taken on Novermeber 28, 2018 for our visualization:\n",

    "So we can view our the .CSV but that is a alot of data for a non-programmer to look at. We have over 8,000 rows and 21 columns. Taking this data and making visualizations in PowerPoint or Tableau would take a bit of time. Instead, we will use <b>Python for data anyalsis</b> or <b>pandas</b> for short. \n",
